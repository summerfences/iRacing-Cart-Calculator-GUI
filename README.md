# iRacing-Addon-Cost-Calculator-GUI
A Java port of the C++ program I had previously written for calculating the price of an iRacing cart, now with a GUI!

I ported the previous program over to Java and implemented a Swing GUI, making the program much more usable.button. Currently, no sales tax is supported, and the only supported currency is USD. However, I plan to implement EUR and sales tax in future updates.
Simply enter the number of each type of addon you'd like to add to the cart, and click the button! There's no need to enter zero for any value.
